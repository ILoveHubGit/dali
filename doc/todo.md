## Bugs

* Curvy arrow width and height changes (make it 20, 20), cause the
  arrowhead to render away from the end of the line
* Transforms in the parents of elements are not taken into account by
  the layout code. Also anything else that would affect dimensions is
  not taken into account (like font properties).

## Features

* Bounds calculation caching
* Native calculation of "easy" bounds
* Embedded CSS
